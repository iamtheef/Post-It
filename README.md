# Post-It
A smaller scale reddit made with MERN Stack and Bulma.

Every user has to be registered and logged in, in order to use the site.
Upon registration users have in their desposal the features below:
* **Posting** (includes all 3 types of posts: text, image, link type)
* **Voting** (voting a post and shaping their karma, also helping the post itself to reach to more audience)
* **Commenting** (leaving comments to posts using a rich text editor

Link posting uses data scraping and supports any link.
Image posts use additional space because users do actual uploading to the server where the image is stored and recalled.
All kind of forms and submits to the server have a specific schema and fields that are validated by the server before proceeding.

Samples of the app can be found below (gifs):
